# Battleship

This is a simple clone of the popular game Battleship. In this strategy boardgame, you will fight against the computer, looking to gain control over the sea. 
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## How it works
After clicking the start button, you will find two grid boards on the screen.

Your ships and the enemy's ships will be randomized within their respective grids. In the first grid board, you will try to bring down the enemy ships by clicking in the cells whenever it is your turn while the computer will try to take your ships on the second gridboard. 

Beware! Each of the players have 5 ships, and as soon as one of the players takes down all of them, he will remain victorious!
